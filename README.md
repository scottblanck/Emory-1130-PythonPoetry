“A World of Dew” by Kobayashi Issa

A world of dew,

And within every dewdrop

A world of struggle.



“A Poppy Blooms” by Katsushika Hokusai

I write, erase, rewrite

Erase again, and then

A poppy blooms.

This is a new form.


“In a Station of the Metro” by Ezra Pound

The apparition of these faces in the crowd;

Petals on a wet, black bough.




Final Poem for Thursday

Sonia Sanchez “Haiku [for you]”

love between us is

speech and breath. loving you is

a long river running.

The End
