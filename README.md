“A World of Dew” by Kobayashi Issa

A world of dew,

And within every dewdrop

A world of struggle.


“In a Station of the Metro” by Ezra Pound

The apparition of these faces in the crowd;

Petals on a wet, black bough.


Final Poem for Thursday

Sonia Sanchez “Haiku [for you]”

love between us is

speech and breath. loving you is

a long river running.
